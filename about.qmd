# About the project 

The Xetthecum map is part of a larger initiative begun by [Whiteswan Environmental](https://www.whiteswanenvironmental.org/digital-ecocultural-mapping.html) (WE), who are working collaboratively on several Indigenous-led projects that support community healing through the natural, cultural and historical restoration of the Salish Sea. The aim of this collaborative work is to restore traditional Indigenous practices and access to place, supporting thriving cultures and coastal ecosystems for future generations. WE initiated the Spirit of the Sxwo’le (SOS) Coalition and through this coalition are collaborating with IMERSS (the Institute for Multidisciplinary Ecological Research in the Salish Sea) and developing a Memorandum of Agreement and bylaws that will help to ensure that all partners in this work respect Indigenous leadership and abide by appropriate cultural sensitivity, cultural humility and cultural safety protocols. WE believe this endeavor will offer a measure of cultural, historical and ecological health protection and sustainability that can be modeled across the United States and Canada. To learn more about the project and collaboration with Whiteswan Environmental please watch the YouTube video [Ecocultural Mapping in the Salish Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v84S7DeORU). 

The Xetthecum/Retreat Cove location was chosen for the pilot project because there was a fair amount of existing information regarding the area’s biodiversity and cultural history. This allowed us to create something that would showcase and support the longer term vision for this work. These existing resources included historical and contemporary biodiversity data, terrestrial ecosystem mapping data, published ecocultural resources, documentation from past participatory mapping of the ecological communities of Galiano Island, and knowledge shared by Penelakut elder, Thiyuas (Florence James). 

The digital ecocultural mapping tool provides information about species and ecological communities, while at the same time protecting sacred Indigenous knowledge through controlled access to certain information as desired by the community. In addition to photographic documentation, it features artwork from local Indigenous artists and youth and serves as a tool to support the gathering of place-based stories from elders and others in the community. The tool also promotes ecocultural mapping as a professional conservation practice among the next generation of land stewards. The mapping tool fosters open access to science, scholarship, technology and art. It promotes intergenerational, cross-cultural, multidisciplinary, and transboundary skill-sharing and knowledge exchange.
