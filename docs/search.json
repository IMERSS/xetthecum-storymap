    "text": "About the project\nThe Xetthecum digital ecocultural mapping project began in 2020 and has been created through the collaborative effort of many people. The map documents Xetthecum’s sensitive ecosystems and cultural keystone species, and integrates various sources of information including historical and contemporary biodiversity data, terrestrial ecosystem mapping, written and spoken Hul’q’umi’num’, stories of place and other audio and visual media. The tool provides an education resource and promotes ecocultural mapping as a professional conservation practice among the next generation of land stewards. Through this work we aim to have a positive impact on the community and the environment.\nThe Xetthecum map is part of a larger initiative begun by Whiteswan Environmental (WE), who are working collaboratively on several Indigenous-led projects that support community healing through the natural, cultural and historical restoration of the Salish Sea.\n\n\nLearn more"
