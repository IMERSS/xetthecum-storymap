##  Land acknowledgement
</center>

It is with gratitude that we recognize the enduring connection of Indigenous Peoples to the land, waters, and all living beings within the transboundary bioregion of the Salish Sea, a richly biodiverse expanse that has been tended to and cherished by the Coast Salish people since time immemorial. We acknowledge and appreciate the wisdom and stewardship that has shaped this region over countless generations, and are grateful for the opportunity to be a part of the intricate tapestry of cultural and ecological diversity. We acknowledge the history and ongoing presence of Indigenous Peoples in this area and strive to foster relationships that honor and respect the rights, traditions, and contributions of the Coast Salish and Hul’q’umi’num’-speaking peoples.

##  Xetthecum Digital Ecocultural Mapping Project
</center>

This website is the culmination of an interdisciplinary, participatory and inclusive digital mapping project that aims to meaningfully braid together Indigenous ways of knowing and Western ecological science to create an interactive, educational, ecocultural map of a region known as Xetthecum in the Hul’q’umi’num’ language (Retreat Cove in English), on Galiano Island, BC, Canada. We hope you enjoy exploring this site where you can learn about the local biodiversity, Hul’q’umi’num’ species names, the cultural and ecological values of various species and ecological communities, and more.

### About the project
 
The Xetthecum digital ecocultural mapping project began in 2020 and has been created through the collaborative effort of [many people](/about.html). The map documents Xetthecum’s sensitive ecosystems and cultural keystone species, and integrates various sources of information including historical and contemporary biodiversity data, terrestrial ecosystem mapping, written and spoken Hul’q’umi’num’, stories of place and other audio and visual media. The tool provides an education resource and promotes ecocultural mapping as a professional conservation practice among the next generation of land stewards. Through this work we aim to have a positive impact on the community and the environment.

The Xetthecum map is part of a larger initiative begun by [Whiteswan Environmental (WE)](https://www.whiteswanenvironmental.org/digital-ecocultural-mapping.html), who are working collaboratively on several Indigenous-led projects that support community healing through the natural, cultural and historical restoration of the Salish Sea.

## Community contribution

Many community members have contributed to the creation of this tool and continue to collaborate on the project. In addition, the mapping tool provides a resource that anyone can contribute to as citizen scientists, with their own data, observations and knowledge.
